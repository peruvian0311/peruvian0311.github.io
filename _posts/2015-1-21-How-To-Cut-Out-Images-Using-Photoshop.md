Tracing using illustrator could be a bit easier, but with unwanted results.  All it takes in illustrator is a click and boom! It is traced completely, you can change color, see outline, etc., but is it really what you were looking for? The lines may come out and some may not and also the shape might take on another form. The best tool to cut out an image or trace it would be the pen tool. There is the lasso tool and other methods, but there is not the same level of control. With that being said we start


We will do this process in Photoshop, but the same way the pen tool is used in illustrator.Now open your image in Photoshop and using your pen tool trace around the outside. There are two ways to do this. You could click and drag on each anchor point to get the right curves but I find this process too slow. I prefer to click around the object and then go back and adjust the curves/anchor points. It is users preference.

Make sure your pen tool is set to Create Path and that the path option is “add to path area”. See image below.

 The image below shows the rough work path I lay down first. If the image you are cutting is quite detailed, like mine, zoom in (Ctrl +) and out (Ctrl - ) as you work.

 It is EXTREMELY important to close the work path so that it can be made into a selection. This means that your last anchor point must meet up to the first anchor point. Once you have made your way around the object you must click once more on the starting point. When you get to the starting anchor point it will be marked with a small circle. See image below.

The trick is to know where to put anchor points, and this is something that comes with a little practice. The pen tool does become very easy, but initially it will be slow, so try not to get put off.

Now right click on the work path and select Make Selection.
Copy the selection (Ctrl + c) and paste it on to another image (Ctrl + v)

Due to the partial pixel selection the image blends smoothly on the new background
