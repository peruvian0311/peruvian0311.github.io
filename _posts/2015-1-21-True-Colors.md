Many people always judge a person by their looks, last name, and the color of the skin, but never take the time to see what is really deep inside of that person.  My name is Juan Fernando Nunez Fernandez, born in Peru and moved to the United States at the young age of nine. I graduated high school in 2008 and a week later I was on my way to Marine Corp basic Training. I was completely transformed all the way from the bottom to the top making me a better man.  

I have experienced a lot in the past four years, some are good experiences and others I just wish I never lived. At the age of eighteen not too long after graduating from the school of infantry I was on my way to Afghanistan.  Seven months later I returned home safely and hoped to never go back again, but unfortunately not even a close to a year of my arrival to the United States  I was returning for a eleven month deployment.  This time it was a more pleasurable experience, because I got to travel all over Europe and got to see what poverty was really like when we stopped in Africa.

My life as a high school student was a little tough due to English being my second language. At the end of the day I grasped everything, but it took me a lot more concentration than others.  Being out of school for so long has not helped either, so sometimes I feel a little out of place.  I know school is hard , but I will do anything to push through it and learn as much as I can. I am a person that loves challenges and I see school as something I can overcome with honors.
