There is always a feeling of wonder when it comes to going to the movie theater, because you never know how good a movie is or you don’t know what is playing.  You are out with your friends and all of the sudden there aren’t many activities going on that day and you find yourself at the movie theater. You have heard that a certain movie is good, but as individuals we are all different. So when you go watch the movie you think it was a waste of your money and wish u have never listened to that person in the first place. Now days it has become easier to predict the level of goodness of a movie through the Internet. Fandango solves all problems we have with not knowing what is playing, How good a movie is , and what rating society has dictated. Of course there is always a percentage that it is not accurate for the most part it is. Fandango layout will give you a summary of the movie, a trailer, reviews and rating. I will set example below

**Get hard**

**Cinderella**

Kenneth Branagh directs Disney's 2015, live-action take on the classic fairy tale Cinderella, which stars Lily James as the put-upon young women forced to endure a life of labor at the hands of her stepmother (Cate Blanchett) after her father dies unexpectedly. Forced to do every menial chore imaginable, Ella maintains her good spirits and eventually strikes up a friendship with a stranger in the woods who turns out to be the prince. When the royal court holds a gala ball, Cinderella wants nothing more to attend, and although her stepmother won't allow it, she gets help from a surprising source. ~ Perry Seibert, Rovi
